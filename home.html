<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p class="welcome">For over one hundred years, Toddington Town Band has been proud to bring music and pleasure to contented audiences across Bedfordshire and and beyond. We currently have more than thirty five active players of all ages and standards. Our extensive library of over 400 pieces of music provides means we are able to play a wide range of music of differing genres which offers enjoyment and challenges for the beginner and experienced musician alike.<br>

Although the band has won many prizes and competitions over the years, it no longer contests but remains very active with many public performances such as formal concerts, bandstands, fetes and garden parties throughout the year. As well as the full brass band, we often perform as a smaller ensemble suitable for the occasions when 30 or more players are just too many!<br>

We also enjoy a range of social activities through the year â€¦ from bowling and barbecues, to our own fireworks display and Christmas Dinner. The band practices at Toddington Social Club on a Tuesday evening where warm welcome awaits from this friendly bunch of people.</p>
